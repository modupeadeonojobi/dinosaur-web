                <h3>Their history</h3>

                <p>Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria</p>
                <img src="img/dinosaur.jpg" alt="dinosaur in the city">
                <p>They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23 million 
                    years ago, although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs 
                    is the subject of active research.</p>

                <p>They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic 
                    extinction event 201.3 million years ago; their dominance continued throughout 
                    the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.</p>

                <p>As such, birds were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the Cretaceous–Paleogene 
                    extinction event approximately 66 million years ago. Dinosaurs can therefore be 
                    divided into avian dinosaurs, or birds; and non-avian dinosaurs, which are all 
                    dinosaurs other than birds.</p>

                <h3>People love dinosaurs!</h3>
                <p>Since the first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th century, 
                    mounted fossil dinosaur skeletons have been major attractions at museums 
                    around the world, and dinosaurs have become an enduring part of world culture</p>
                
                <p>The large sizes of some dinosaur groups, as well as their seemingly monstrous 
                and fantastic nature, have ensured dinosaurs' regular appearance in best-selling 
                books and films, such as Jurassic Park</p>
        
                <p> Persistent public enthusiasm for the animals has resulted in significant funding 
                    for dinosaur science, and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media.</p>

                    You know you're the first person to lay hands on a critter that lived 80 or 90 million years ago".
